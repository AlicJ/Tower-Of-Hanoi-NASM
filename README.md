Tower-Of-Hanoi-NASM
=================== 

Tower of Hanoi implemented in NASM

Final project for CS 2XA3 in McMaster University.

Using it as your submission to the project is extremely prohibited. 
I do not take any responsibilities for any outcome. 
You may read it, understand it, and reproduce it without explicit copying (that said, make your own version!) 

Special thanks to http://www.kernelthread.com/projects/hanoi/html/asm.html for the inspiration of tower of hanoi core recursion function.
